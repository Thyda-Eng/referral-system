## Introduction

Malaria Day Zero Alert System is a web base application with SMS service that  enable the health center staff (HC) and village malaria worker (VMW) to send malaria case reporting  from the village or health center via SMS to the system and make automatic SMS alert to supervised health center, operational district (OD), Provincial heath department(PHD), National Level or System Administrator. Online system also provide ability to view  report, manage users and places, set threshold,  send alert to group or individual, and templates message setting. The project is currently being hosted with url http://md0.cnm.gov.org  .

## Overview

The shift over the last few years away from failing drugs to the highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has been a breakthrough, and it was hoped that their design as combinations of two efficacious drugs with different modes of action would preserve them for many years of use. Â However, recent evidence suggests that artemisinin tolerant/resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites are present on the Thai-Cambodian border and it is imperative to mount a vigorous response to stop spread from areas where artemisinin resistance has been identified, whilst simultaneously undertaking further research to define the nature and geographical extent of the problem.
As day-3 reporting model has proved to be an effective mechanism for reporting cases by SMS, and in light of the move towards the elimination of malaria in Cambodia, it has been decided to scale up the system day-0 reporting of all Pf cases from VMWs and health facilities. As the number of cases will be higher for day-0 than day-3 and given the probable need for more widespread implementation it has been decided to move to a more robust internet based platform.
